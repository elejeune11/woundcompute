## Project Summary <a name="summary"></a>

This software is designed to analyze experimental data from micro-tissue wound experiments (see: [references](#references)). The goal of our software is to extract quantitative information from these images and movies. For example, we can automatically identify the wound region which allows us extract properties such as wound area, major axis length, and minor axis length with respect to time.

We are also adding additional funcitonality for tracking tissue deformation between frames -- stay tuned!

## Project Roadmap <a name="roadmap"></a>

We plan to develop and disseminate an "all-purpose" software for data curation and analysis from micro-tissue wound experiments. The roadmap for this collaborative endeavor is as follows:

`Preliminary Dataset + Software` $\mapsto$ `Larger Dataset + Software Testing and Validation` $\mapsto$ `Published Software Package` $\mapsto$ `Published Validation Examples and Tutorial` $\mapsto$ `Automated Analysis of High-Throughput Experiments`

At present (**September 2022**) we are in the process of testing and validating our software on larger datasets. Specifically, we are (1) identifying scenarios where our approach fails and creating functions to accomodate them, and (2) comparing software results to previous manual approaches for extracting quantitative information. We will continue to update this repository as the project progresses.

## Installation Instructions <a name="install"></a>

### Get a copy of the wound compute repository on your local machine

The best way to do this is to create a GitHub account and ``clone`` the repository. However, you can also download the repository by clicking the green ``Code`` button and selecting ``Download ZIP``. Downloaded and unzip the ``woundcompute-main`` folder and place it in a convenient location on your computer.

### Create and activate a conda virtual environment

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your local machine.
2. Open a ``Terminal`` session (or equivalent) -- note that Mac computers come with ``Terminal`` pre-installed (type ``âŒ˜-space`` and then search for ``Terminal``).
3. Type in the terminal to create a virtual environment with conda:
```bash
conda create --name wound-compute-env python=3.9.13
```
4. Type in the terminal to activate your virtual environment:
```bash
conda activate wound-compute-env
```
5. Check to make sure that the correct version of python is running (should be ``3.9.13``)
```bash
python --version
```
6. Update some base modules (just in case)
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

Note that once you have created this virtual environment you can ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` it in the future -- it is not necessary to create a new virtual environment each time you want to run this code, you can simply type ``conda activate wound-compute-env`` and then pick up where you left off (see also: [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)).

### Install wound compute

1. Use a ``Terminal`` session to navigate to the ``woundcompute-main`` folder. The command ``cd`` will allow you to do this (see: [terminal cheat sheet](https://terminalcheatsheet.com/))
2. Type the command ``ls`` and make sure that the file ``pyproject.toml`` is in the current directory.
3. Now, create an editable install of wound compute:
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```
4. If you would like to see what packages this has installed, you can type ``pip list``
5. You can test that the code is working with pytest:
```bash
pytest -v --cov=woundcompute  --cov-report term-missing
```
6. To run the code from the terminal, simply start python (type ``python``) and then type ``from woundcompute import image_analysis as ia``. For example:
```bash
(wound-compute-env) eml-macbook-pro:woundcompute-main emma$ python
Python 3.9.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 27 2022, 17:01:00) 
[Clang 13.0.1 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from woundcompute import image_analysis as ia
>>> 
```
